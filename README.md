## Final project plan

## Where it Pays to Attend College
#### Salaries by college, region, and academic major

##### Overview: 
Recently there have been rise in non-traditional education such as Bootcamps, crash course and MOOC based degree offered by popular platform like EDX.org, Coursera, Udacity challenging establish 4-year college structure. I would like to gain insight about which of these options is better for professional based on location, salary, degree, college, time spent, value for money. This project seems remarkably interesting with respect to changing landscape in Education industry. Non-traditional education promises to provide same level of intellectual training with smaller investment with respect to time and finance, but its effectiveness is difficult to measure. Based on dataset the goal is to measure effectiveness of College on salary progression and how regional location of university influences.  
##### Data Set :
My Data Set has been obtained from the Wall Street Journal based on data from Payscale, Inc hosted on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/wsj/college-salaries ) 
 I have access to following data.

##### Scope : 
My focus for final project is to perform exploratory data analysis to answer following question : 
 
1.	To explore which major has better career prospect after graduation. 
2.	Explore growth in earning for a certain major as passage of time 
3.	Compare Salary for College by Type and College by Region. 
4.	Provide a graphical interface to get information based on college. 

##### Tools and Platform 
 As perr process and tools. I will be using Python 3.x and Jupyter notebook provided under anaconda distribution. 
 To showcase, all the of my work I will be using Github
  
##### Shortcoming in my Dataset: 

•	I don't have access to any data set for nontraditional education system to perform analysis on their success criteria. So it would be really difficult to perform any comparative analysis.

•	Based on the timeline of related article on this dataset, it seems this dataset is of year 2008 , which is almost a decade in past. 

•	This dataset only covers universities in United States, which provides a viewpoint or success matrix in US  but there are a lot more well of recognized university outside United States.
